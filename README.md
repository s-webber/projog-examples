[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/s-webber/projog-examples.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/s-webber/projog-examples)

## About

This project contains examples of how the open source [Projog](http://projog.org "Prolog interpreter for Java") library can be used to integrate Java with [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog).

`calling-java-from-prolog` provides an example of how you can interact with a Prolog inference engine from a Java application.

`calling-prolog-from-java` provides examples of how to extend the functionality of Prolog by writing new built-in predicates and arithmetic operations using Java. This project also contains examples of how you can unit test the new functionality using the Projog test framework.

`debugging-prolog-from-java` provides an example of how to obtaining debug information for Prolog queries called from a Java application.
