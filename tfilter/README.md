# tfilter/3

## About

Provides example of how `tfilter/3` can be implemented using the open source [Projog](http://projog.org "Prolog interpreter for Java") library.

Uses version of `tfilter/3` from https://github.com/meditans/reif

This example was created in response to [issue 218](https://github.com/s-webber/projog/issues/218).

This is a work-in-progress proof-of-concept that uses a version of projog-core from `lib` rather than from a maven repository.
